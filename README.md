This is a paper written on the topic of Batch Normalization in Neural Networks. This repository contains the PDF `finalproject.pdf`, as well as the LaTeX file `fifnalproject.tex` to compile the PDF. This paper explores Batch Normalization proposed by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in 2015 to reduce the internal covariate shift between layers of a neural network, ensuring that the first and second moments of layer outputs are standard-normal. This paper presents all the steps in deriving the forward and back propagation calculations pertaining to batch normalization, as well as experimental results applying batch norm.
